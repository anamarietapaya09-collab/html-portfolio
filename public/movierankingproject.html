<h1>The Best Movies According to Ana Marie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>3 Idiots is one of my favorites because it’s funny, emotional, and inspiring all at once. It reminds me to follow
    what I
    love, not just what society expects. Every time I watch it, I learn something new and end up feeling motivated.</p>
<h3>Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Life is Beautiful is one of my favorite movies because it blends humor, love, and tragedy in such a powerful way. The
    story shows how far a parent will go to protect their child, even in the worst circumstances. Guido’s positivity and
    imagination turn a terrifying reality into something bearable for his son, and that message stays with you long
    after the movie ends. It is emotional, inspiring, and a reminder that love can create light even in the darkest
    places.</p>
<h3>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</h3>
<p>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is one of my favorites because it shows the innocence of childhood in the middle of a
    cruel world. The friendship between Bruno and Shmuel is pure and heartbreaking, reminding us how hatred is taught,
    not
    born. The ending stays with you — it is tragic, powerful, and makes you reflect on compassion, ignorance, and the
    real
    cost of prejudice.</p>
